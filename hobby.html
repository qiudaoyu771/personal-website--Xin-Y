		<p>My hobbies are playing the piano and calligraphy. When I am immersed in the notes of the piano, it is as if the whole world has stood still. Each key is the starting point of my extended thoughts, and each melody is the expression of my heart. Playing the Moonlight Sonata, I feel as if I am strolling on a moonlit path, feeling the tranquility and beauty.

Calligraphy, on the other hand, is another expression of my soul. In the quiet study, I waved the brush and splashed ink, each stroke is my perception of life. The smell of ink fills the room, and the words float in the air, as if a spiritual dialog is unfolding between me and the paper.

Piano and calligraphy are an indispensable part of my life. They allow me to find inner peace and tranquility, and enable me to express my emotions and thoughts in a unique way. Whether it is on the keys or on paper, I can find my place and my own voice. They are not just my hobby, they are the sound of my soul in my life, accompanying me through every day and night.</p>
