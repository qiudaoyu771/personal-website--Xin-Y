	<p>I am a student from China, currently in my second year of Business Economics at York University. As a Scorpio INTJ personality type, I focus on logical thinking and independent thinking, and like to find solutions by analyzing problems in depth.

My personal preferences reflect my inner softness and uniqueness. Although the INTJ personality is usually considered rational and strict, my favorite color is pink, which represents my desire for tenderness and beauty. I find that the color pink brings pleasure and relaxation, while also showing a softer side of me.

In my home, there are three lovely kittens. I am attracted to cats because their spirituality and independence connects with my heart. Spending time with cats makes me feel relaxed and happy, and they have become an integral part of my life.

Although I specialize in Business Economics, my interests and hobbies go far beyond that. Piano and calligraphy are my two main hobbies in my spare time, which bring me spiritual fulfillment and pleasure. At the same time, I am also passionate about exploring new knowledge and skills, pursuing self-improvement on the path of continuous learning and growth.

I see my life as a continuous journey of growth, where every day is a new challenge and opportunity. I strive to maintain inner balance and harmony, and constantly pursue the dreams and goals in my heart.</p>
